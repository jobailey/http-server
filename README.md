# HTTP Server 

## Purpose
This is a script designed to create a simple webserver for the **localhost** to access. I had never worked with Python as a language before, so this is my first time getting familiarized with some of the functions in the Python 3 library. Some of the web development capabilities of Python 3 are used in the creation of this webserver. 

## Usage
***Begin at the command line with administrator privileges***

$ telnet localhost 8080
- Open a browser 
- View [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Future Development
- Deploy a web page for user registration
- Implement HTML and CSS 
- 

## Dependencies
