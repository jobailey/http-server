# HTTP Server

This is a script designed to create a simple webserver for the **localhost** to access. I had never worked with Python as a language before, so this is my first time getting familiarized with some of the functions in the Python 3 library. Some of the web development capabilities of Python 3 are used in the creation of this webserver.
