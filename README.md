# HTTP Server 

## Description
This is a script designed to create a simple webserver for the **localhost** to access. I had never worked with Python as a language before, so this is my first time getting familiarized with some of the functions in the Python 3 library. It was created with guidance from Andrew Klatzke at A Medium Corporation.
